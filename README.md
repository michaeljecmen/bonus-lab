### EECS 281 Bonus Lab

These files are examples used in a bonus lab for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Michigan.

If you're a current IA for that course (or anyone, really), feel free to use these files and [the corresponding replit](https://replit.com/@MichaelJecmen/EECS281BONUSLAB?v=1) (replit is an interactive web-based IDE that I've found useful for live demos), for instructional purposes. The slides should still be in the common/ folder on the Google Drive, and there should be at least one recording of the talk on the official EECS 281 YouTube channel. Feel free to reach out if you have trouble locating either of these resources.

Also feel free to fork this or submit PRs if you'd like to see changes.

## Usage
Mosey on over to the replit (linked above), hit "fork", then "view files". Alternatively, make your own replit, using the contents of these files as you please.

Each file is intended to be a separate demo. Compile each file as you use and edit it with the provided makefile. I would suggest walking through the examples in main() for each file, uncommenting the print statements and asking students to guess what the output at relevant lines will be before running.

Brief descriptions of each file:
* ```copy.cpp```: custom vector class which showcases the need for move semantics
* ```move.cpp```:
